## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to use the grid display property for this project.


```css
For web display
.buttons {
    text-align: center;
    display: grid;
    grid-template: repeat(3, 1fr)/ repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
}
For mobile display
.buttons {
        grid-template: repeat(2, 1fr)/ repeat(2, 1fr);
        margin-bottom: 25px; 
    }
```
```js
btns.forEach(btn => btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    
    let buttons = btn.innerText
    let btnValue = parseFloat(parseInt(buttons) / 100)

}))
```


### Continued development

Learn more about grid display.
DOM manipulation in JavaScript 


### Useful resources

- [Complete Grid Tutorial with Cheat Sheet By Joy Shaheb](https://www.example.com) - This helped me to use the display grid property. I really loved and fairly understood(I will still go back to it later) but was able to use it very well in this project.
- [How to Center Anything with CSS - Align a Div, Text, and More](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/amp/)- This amazing article helped me to center the div container using flex display. I learned how to center a div using different approach and it will be my go to article anytime I'm having issue centering a div.
